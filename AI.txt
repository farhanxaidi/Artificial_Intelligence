Artificial Intelligence Project
We are going to classify data written in a file. To perform this task, we need to perform the following steps:
1.	Read data from file (Make your own file including text data)
2.	Remove stop words and symbols from it
3.	Implement k-means clustering
You can use any library or build-in function in the project but can be able to answer about that during viva.
Deadline: Viva will be in the last lab (lab before Eid). If a student give viva in next week lab, he or she will get 2 absolute marks in the project.
Note: You can do the project either individually or in the group of 2
